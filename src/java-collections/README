Running example:

./shakira.sh -DNPROG=3 -DNPREDS=1 ../../tests/java-collections/set-const-unsafe.c

If the example is unsafe you can execute the counter-example. To
generate .png files at various points during the execution of the
program, add calls to dump_heap in the test program:

dump_heap(heap, <file-name>, <pretty-heap-args>);

You can compile and execute the counterexample using the following command:

./gcc-debug.sh -DNPROG=3 -DNPREDS=1 ../../tests/java-collections/set-const-unsafe.c

It will create a file counterexample.c and then compile the input
file, with shakira-test.c and with the counterexample.c file. It will
also treat all Assume's as assert. It will create and run an
executable file debug.out that executes the transformers on the
counter-example.
